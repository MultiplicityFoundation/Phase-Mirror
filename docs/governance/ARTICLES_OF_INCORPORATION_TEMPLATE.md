## ARTICLE II - PURPOSES

This corporation is organized exclusively for charitable, educational, and scientific purposes within the meaning of Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").

Specifically, the corporation shall:

1. Develop, maintain, and promote open-source specifications and implementations for agentic domain-specific reasoning systems, including but not limited to QAGI (Query-Augmented General Intelligence), Multiplicity Protocol, and Phase Mirror Dissonance Protocol.

2. Provide educational resources, documentation, and training materials to advance the understanding and responsible deployment of agentic reasoning systems.

3. Foster community collaboration and governance around open standards for AI safety, interpretability, and accountability.

4. Conduct research and publish findings related to the verification, validation, and monitoring of autonomous systems.

## ARTICLE III - NONPROFIT STATUS

This corporation is organized as a nonprofit corporation under Chapter 1702 of the Ohio Revised Code. The corporation shall not have or issue shares of stock. No dividends shall be paid, and no part of the income or assets of the corporation shall be distributed to its directors, officers, or other private persons, except as reasonable compensation for services rendered or reimbursement for expenses incurred on behalf of the corporation.

---

## ARTICLE IV - DURATION

The corporation shall have perpetual existence unless dissolved in accordance with Ohio law and these Articles.

---

## ARTICLE V - PROTECTED INVARIANTS (NON-WAIVABLE PRINCIPLES)

The following principles are fundamental to the mission of the corporation and may only be modified or waived by:
- Unanimous vote of all directors
- Written petition from at least 10% of certified implementations
- Legal requirement (court order, IRS determination, regulatory mandate)

### 5.1 Public Access Commitment
All core specifications (QAGI, Multiplicity, Phase Mirror) shall be publicly accessible at no cost and under a permissive open-source license (Apache License 2.0 or more permissive). This commitment is perpetual and survives dissolution.

### 5.2 Trademark Protection
All trademarks owned by the corporation (QAGI, Multiplicity, Phase Mirror, Citizen Gardens, and related marks) shall be used solely to:
- Protect the integrity and authenticity of specifications
- Prevent confusion or misrepresentation
- Enable conformance testing and certification

The corporation shall not use trademarks to restrict legitimate use of the specifications or create monopolistic control over implementations.

### 5.3 Fail-Closed Security Posture
All systems operated by the corporation that validate claims, issue credentials, or attest to compliance shall default to "fail-closed" behavior: when a verification system is unavailable or compromised, it shall reject requests rather than silently accept unverified claims.

### 5.4 Privacy-Respecting Calibration
The corporation shall collect only aggregated, anonymized data for improving detection rules. Individual organization identifiers shall be cryptographically hashed (HMAC with rotating salts), and all queries shall enforce k-anonymity (minimum 10 organizations per result set). Raw organizational data shall never be sold, licensed, or disclosed except as required by law.
