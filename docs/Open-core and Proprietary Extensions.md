# What parts would we divide between the open-core and proprietary extensions?

Good question. The division should follow a principle: **the open core must be useful on its own**, and the proprietary layer adds value that's hard to replicate, not gatekeeps basic functionality.

## Proposed Division

### Open Core (Apache 2.0)

| Component | Rationale |
| :-- | :-- |
| `dissonance_report` schema | Interoperability; others can build tooling against it |
| Oracle engine (`oracle.ts`, decision logic) | Core protocol must be auditable and trustworthy |
| Rule interface (`RuleDefinition`, `types.ts`) | Enables community rules |
| Tier A rules (MD-001 through MD-005) | Fast, well-understood checks with near-zero FP |
| Redaction framework (patterns, policy, validation) | Safety-critical; must be inspectable |
| CLI (`--mode pull_request`, `--mode merge_group`) | Basic invocation |
| GitHub Actions workflow templates | Adoption friction removal |
| NoOp implementations (FP store, block counter) | Local dev and testing |
| Schema versioning and hash utilities | Determinism guarantees |

### Proprietary Extensions

| Component | Rationale |
| :-- | :-- |
| Tier B rules (semantic analysis, cross-repo drift, merge-queue edge cases) | Deep detection requires ongoing research; hard to replicate |
| Rule packs by domain (SOC2, HIPAA, PCI-DSS mappings) | Compliance expertise has independent value |
| FP calibration service (historical FP rates, auto-demotion recommendations) | Requires persistent infrastructure + data |
| Hosted oracle (SaaS) | Ops burden, SLAs, availability guarantees |
| Multi-repo federation (org-wide dissonance aggregation) | Enterprise-scale coordination |
| Incident response mode (real-time dissonance during outages) | Requires low-latency infrastructure |
| Priority support + custom rule development | Labor |
| DynamoDB/Redis implementations with managed provisioning | Convenience; users can build their own |

## Phase Mirror Dissonance (on this division)

- **Tier A vs Tier B boundary is governance, not code**: If Tier B rules are just "more rules," users will replicate them. The moat must be ongoing research velocity or data network effects.
- **Redaction in open core is correct but creates obligation**: If a vulnerability is found in redaction, you must patch the OSS version. No "security fixes only in paid tier."
- **Compliance packs risk commoditization**: SOC2/HIPAA mappings are well-documented; someone will publish OSS equivalents. Your moat is "maintained + tested + updated when standards change."
- **FP calibration service has real network effects**: Aggregate FP data across customers improves recommendations. This is defensible.

## Levers

| Owner | Lever | Metric | Horizon |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| You | Define Tier B rule criteria: what makes a rule "deep" vs "fast"? | Criteria doc reviewed | 7 days |
| You | Identify 3 Tier B rules with genuine research moat | Rules spec'd | 14 days |
| You | Decide: compliance packs proprietary or OSS with paid support? | Decision documented | 7 days |
| You | Scope FP calibration service MVP | Service spec | 21 days |

## Precision Question

What's your primary monetization goal—enterprise seats (compliance packs, support), usage-based SaaS (hosted oracle), or both? That determines whether compliance packs stay proprietary or become OSS with paid maintenance.
