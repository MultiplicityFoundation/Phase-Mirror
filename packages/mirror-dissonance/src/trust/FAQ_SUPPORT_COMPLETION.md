# FAQ and Support Section - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully completed the Nonce Binding Service documentation by adding all missing FAQ entries and the Support section as specified in the problem statement.

## Changes Implemented

### File Modified
**`docs/trust-module/nonce-binding.md`**
- **Before**: 646 lines, 6 FAQ questions, no Support section
- **After**: 674 lines, 11 FAQ questions, Support section added
- **Growth**: +28 lines (+4.3% expansion)

## New Content Added

### 1. Enhanced FAQ Section

#### Updated Existing Question:
**"What happens to FP data after nonce rotation?"**
- **Old Answer**: Mentioned rotation chain and identity continuity
- **New Answer**: Explains orgIdHash behavior and linkability prevention
  - "Historical FP data remains associated with old orgIdHash"
  - "Future submissions use new orgIdHash derived from new nonce"
  - "This is by design to prevent linkability across rotations"

#### Five New FAQ Questions Added:

**1. Can I have multiple nonces for different environments?**
```
A: No. One org = one nonce. For multiple environments 
(dev/staging/prod), create separate Phase Mirror organizations 
with separate verifications.
```

**2. Can I manually specify my nonce value?**
```
A: No. Nonces are generated by the system to ensure uniqueness 
and prevent collisions.
```

**3. How do I back up my nonce?**
```
A: Nonces are stored in your identity record 
(.trust-data/identities.json for local storage). 
Back up this file securely. If lost, use rotation to 
generate new nonce.
```

**4. Does nonce binding affect k-anonymity?**
```
A: No. Nonce binding happens at the identity layer 
(before FP submission). The nonce is still hashed to create 
orgIdHash for k-anonymity. Binding does not expose org 
identity in calibration network.
```

**5. Can I transfer my nonce to another organization?**
```
A: No. Nonces are cryptographically bound to verified 
identities and cannot be transferred.
```

### 2. New Support Section

Added comprehensive support information before "Related Documentation":

- ✅ Section placement logical
- ✅ Cross-references maintained

## Key Topics Covered

### Security & Privacy
1. **k-anonymity Preservation**: Binding doesn't expose org identity
2. **Linkability Prevention**: New orgIdHash after rotation
3. **Cryptographic Binding**: Cannot transfer nonces
4. **System-Generated**: Prevents collisions and gaming

### Operational Guidance
1. **Environment Separation**: Create separate orgs for dev/staging/prod
2. **Backup Strategy**: Identity record file location
3. **Recovery Procedures**: Rotation for lost nonces
4. **Support Channels**: Multiple contact methods

### Limitations & Constraints
