# Tier B Rule Development

## Every Tier B rule must:
1. Call `requirePro(context, 'MD-XXX: Rule Name')` as the first line of `evaluate()`
2. Import `RuleDefinition`, `Finding`, `AnalysisContext` from `../types.js`
3. Export a `rule` object implementing `RuleDefinition`
4. Include: id, name, description, version, tier ('B'), severity, fpTolerance, promotionCriteria
5. Return `Finding[]` — never throw (catch internally, return empty array on parse failure)
6. Include at least 8 tests: true positive, true negative, edge cases, performance, error handling

## Import pattern:
```typescript
import type { RuleDefinition, Finding, AnalysisContext } from '../types.js';
import { requirePro } from '../../license-gate.js';
```

## The tension each rule must name:
Every Tier B rule surfaces a specific contradiction in governance assumptions.
Document what assumption the rule challenges in the `description` field.
